# ruff?

## kitchen sink python linter

 - 10-100x faster than existing linters
 - support for automatic error correction
 - over 500 built-in rules
 - easy integrations for IDEs and ships an LSP
 - documentation, testing, code complexity

## what does it replace?

- `flake8`
- dozens of `flake8` plugins like bugbear, tryceratops
- `isort`
- `pydocstyle`
- `eradicate`
- `pyupgrade`
- `autoflake`

## use it with?

 - use `ruff` in conjunction with type checking and formatting tools
 - `mypy` and `black` are my go-tos for typing and formatting

# Basic usage

## `pip install ruff`

 - `ruff` enables `pycodestyle` and `flake8` by default
 - full default configuration can be found here:
https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/configuration/#using-pyprojecttoml
 - can use `pyproject.toml` or `ruff.toml` files for configuration,  
 configuration files can be cascading in cases of large repos

## `ruff check . --fix`

 - ðŸ”¥ __FAST__ ðŸ”¥
 - results are cached locally in `.ruff_cache`
 - fixes "fixable" errors, not all errors are fixable
 - lots of other options like `--show-source` or `--diff`

## `ruff rule <RULE>`

 - provides rust-style explanation of the given rule
 - sometimes includes an example of before/after
